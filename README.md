# Linux-LFCS-Labs

This repository contains my hands-on Linux learning labs as part of the
Powercoders Connecting Program and my preparation for the
Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) certification.

The goal is to understand Linux internals by connecting theory with
practical experiments and clear documentation.

## Learning Structure

Each numbered folder represents one learning topic and week.

Each lab includes:
- README.md – goal and short summary
- commands.md – commands executed
- observations.md – what I learned in my own words
- artifacts/ – saved outputs when relevant
